I realized that I hadn't touched my blog in over a year. A lot had happened since then, but I hadn't taken the time to note anything down. Looking through my old posts, I remember how good it felt to actually sit and write things down.

I thought I'd change the theme and tweak things a bit just for the sake of it. Lo and behold, I ended up spending an entire day trying out themes and tweaking knobs and controls to see how things looked. Sometimes, I feel like I waste a lot of time on preliminary aspects of a task.

Hopefully, I should be able to hammer out something tomorrow.
